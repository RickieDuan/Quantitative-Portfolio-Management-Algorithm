Portfolio Optimization Algorithm: An Application of Modern Portfolio Theory
This project presents a sophisticated portfolio allocation algorithm driven by the principles of Modern Portfolio Theory. It delivers an optimized portfolio by using the Efficient Frontier approach, aiming to maximize returns for a given level of risk.

Technical Stack
Our algorithm harnesses the power of Python and its prominent data science libraries like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis, numerical computations, and visualization.

Key Features
Market Capitalization Analysis: The algorithm considers the market cap of different stocks to gauge their impact on the market and the portfolio.

Beta Analysis: It evaluates the beta of each stock to understand its volatility in relation to the overall market.

Standard Deviation and Expected Return Analysis: By analyzing the standard deviation and expected return, our algorithm assesses the risk and expected gain associated with each stock.

Performance
In a rigorous 4-week testing period, our portfolio optimization algorithm outshone the S&P 500 by a considerable margin, generating 23.3% more returns. This highlights its potential effectiveness as a strategy in the financial market.

We welcome contributions and suggestions to further enhance this project. For any questions or feedback, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
