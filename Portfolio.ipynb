    "The objective of this strategy is to constitute the riskiest portfolio possible, where each individual stock possesses the highest volatility. This can be determined by the standard deviation of each stock. As a statistical measure, standard deviation provides an understanding of the distance from the mean of a data set, or the dispersion of returns from the mean. When applied to a portfolio of stocks, standard deviation serves as an indicator of the volatility of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, based on the spread of returns over a period of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of an investment is a measure of the volatility of returns. Consequently, the higher the standard deviation, the higher the volatility and risk associated with the investment. Financial securities or funds that are volatile typically display a higher standard deviation compared to stable financial securities or investment funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high standard deviation is generally seen as more risky since the performance of the investment can change dramatically in any direction at any given moment. The strategy, therefore, emphasizes the selection of only ten stocks. This is based on the principle that the greater the number of stocks in a portfolio, the less risky it is, a conclusion derived from the concept of diversification in previous analyses. Hence, limiting the number of stocks in the portfolio is a key element in enhancing the risk level."

    "In the process of determining the weight of each stock in the investment, a loop is run 1000 times to ascertain the expected returns and volatility of each portfolio. This approach takes into account the expected return, standard deviation of each stock, as well as the covariance between each pair of stocks, which is expressed as volatility. By doing so, it becomes possible to identify the portfolio with the highest volatility and expected return, which is then selected as the final portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integration of expected return, standard deviation, and covariance of stocks into this process is based on the principles of Markowitz Portfolio Theory. Both the Mean and Variance aspects are considered to carry out a corresponding analysis of each weight of stocks. The ultimate goal is to find the riskiest and most profitable portfolio. As illustrated in the graph, the portfolio may form an ellipse-like shape, showcasing a positive correlation between volatility and returns. The output, therefore, is the point that represents the riskiest but most profitable portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following this, the closing price of the stocks is obtained from finance data providers like Yahoo Finance. With this data, the principal invested at this particular weight of each stock is calculated along with the following statistics. This approach ensures the determination of a high-risk, high-reward portfolio based on comprehensive analysis and financial principles."
